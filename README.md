🚂 Railroad Incident Analysis & Visualization Dashboard
I recently completed an in-depth data analysis project focused on railroad incidents, leveraging Python and powerful visualization libraries to extract meaningful insights from a comprehensive dataset. The goal was to understand patterns, environmental factors, and hotspots related to railroad accidents to support safety improvements and risk management.

🔍 Project Highlights:
🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values, converting date and time columns accurately, and filtering relevant records to ensure data quality for analysis.

📅 Time-Based Analysis:
Explored incident distribution by hour of day, day of week, and month to identify peak periods when accidents are most frequent, enabling targeted safety measures.
Graphs used: Line plots for monthly trends, count plots for hour and day distributions.

🌦️ Environmental Impact Assessment:
Analyzed how weather conditions and light levels influence incident occurrences, providing insights into external risk factors affecting railroad safety.
Graphs used: Count plots for weather and light conditions.

🚥 Equipment & Railroad Company Insights:
Compared incidents across different equipment types and railroad companies using stacked bar charts and pie charts to highlight critical areas for attention.

🗺️ Geospatial Visualization:
Developed interactive heatmaps using Folium to visualize accident hotspots geographically, helping to pinpoint high-risk locations for proactive monitoring.

📈 Trend Analysis:
Tracked monthly incident trends over time to observe fluctuations and identify patterns that could inform policy and operational decisions.
Graphs used: Line plot for monthly incident counts, bar charts for top incident months.

👥 User Demographics Analysis:
Examined demographic factors such as user age to better understand profiles involved in incidents, contributing to more personalized safety interventions.
Graphs used: Histogram of user age distribution.
